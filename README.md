Here Is the Link to My video:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bdg3xTBX3-QCCsECloYQccVVp4lo5gpO/view?usp=sharing Explaining the way my Movies searching website works basically by searching the name of movie and it directly shows all related movies, the day of release and also the picture or the poster of the movie and by having API key in my javascript code that's what helped me get access to those details.
